This was my practise project made when I started learning PHP and MYSQL.

This projects helped me in understanding CRUD operations using PHP and MYSQL.

Simple car parking management system where one will login using "admin" as id and password. 

Screenshot folder contains screenshots of this project.

To run this one need to have Xampp and need to import database file which i have uploaded as well available in database_file.
After importing it one can run it easily by opening login.php available in login directory.
